I am a MA graduate in Public Policy at the University of Chicago's Harris School, applying to PhD programs in Economics for Fall 2026.

My research focuses on **development economics** and **political economy**, with particular emphasis on Latin America. I study how violence, institutions, and labor markets affect human capital formation and economic development.

Before coming to Chicago, I worked as a Research Analyst at the **International Monetary Fund** and as a Research Professional at **Georgetown University**. I am from Barranca, Peru, and received my BA in Economics with honors from Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.

## Working Papers
**When Ideas Become Mainstream? Theory and Empirical Evidence from Econometrics Techniques**
*Solo author* | November 2025

This paper demonstrates that diffusion operates independently across three levels—awareness, adoption, and embedding—each governed by distinct mechanisms. Analyzing six econometric methods using 21,911 citations, 2,744 market observations, and 3,963 researchers (1960-2024), I find that awareness spreads smoothly through citations, but actual adoption faces substantial resistance varying 814-fold across methods.
